## Map Details

Maps build from scratch with just a basic general idea. Most are unexisting, so no blueprint available to work with, creation on the fly. The first 3 maps are from the old days (2009-11), all others are made after my return to FC2 (aug. 2018 and on). 1 map is based on a movie and my current latest map is a recreation of my actual livingplace!
