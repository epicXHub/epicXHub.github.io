Most are unexisting, so no blueprint available to work with, creation on the fly. The first 3 maps are from the old days (2009-11), all others are made after my return to FC2 (aug. 2018 and on). 1 map is based on a movie and my current latest map is a recreation of my actual livingplace!\n\n![Screen shots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epicXHub/epicXHub.github.io/master/DB/assets/buttons/pink-screenshots.svg)\n\n####\n\n![MapPhoto](https://github.com/epicXHub/epicXHub.github.io/blob/master/DB/categories/game/FarCry%202/Maps/City%20of%20glass/CityOfGlass.png?raw=true)\n\n![enter image description here](https://github.com/epicXHub/epicXHub.github.io/blob/master/DB/categories/game/FarCry%202/Maps/City%20of%20glass/CityOfGlassSIDE.jpg?raw=true)\n\n![enter image description here](https://github.com/epicXHub/epicXHub.github.io/blob/master/DB/categories/game/FarCry%202/Maps/City%20of%20glass/CityOfGlassTOP.jpg?raw=true)\n\n## Game Modes\n\nSupports DM & **TDM**.  \nCTD & Uprising won't work in a floating map which can be totally destroyed!\n\n### Object count\n\nTotal: **11.129**.  \nMap is mostly made out of glass windows.  \nIt also contains wooden doors to protect most Ammo Piles lower in the map.\n\n#### File Size\n\nJust a small **1.45 MB**\n\n[![\"Map Download\"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epicXHub/epicXHub.github.io/master/DB/assets/buttons/blue-download.svg)](https://www.google.com/)\n\n[![\"Source\"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epicXHub/epicXHub.github.io/master/DB/assets/buttons/yellow-source.svg)](https://fearfolio.web.app/Map-Creations.html)\n","url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epicXHub/epicXHub.github.io/master/DB/categories/game/FarCry%202/Maps/City%20of%20glass/main.md","desc":"Map is mostly made out of glass windows.
